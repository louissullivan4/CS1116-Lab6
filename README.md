BASIC SNAKE GAME THAT ISNT FINISHED

In your initial version of the program, begin with a snake that consists of just one square, which moves around the screen. 
Write event listeners so that the square changes direction when the user presses the arrow keys.
Improve your program as follows: If the snake attempts to move beyond the edges of the canvas, stop the game and bring 
up a pop-up that displays the user's score.

Improve your program again: In an unoccupied region of the canvas, draw an obstacle. Obstacles don't move. 
But when the snake collides with the obstacle: the obstacle disappears; the player's score goes up by one; and a 
new obstacle is then drawn in a new unoccupied region.
